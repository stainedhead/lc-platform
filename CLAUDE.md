# CLAUDE.md

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: This file is a reference pointer only**

## Source of Truth

**All development rules, guidelines, and agent instructions are maintained in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)**.

This file exists solely to redirect you to the canonical source of development process rules.

## What to Read

For complete information about:
- Project architecture and design patterns
- Development workflow and SpecKit commands
- Implementation guidelines
- Testing strategies
- Quality standards
- Documentation maintenance
- CI/CD processes

**👉 Please refer to [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)**

## Making Changes

**DO NOT suggest or make changes to this file (CLAUDE.md).**

If you need to update development rules, guidelines, or agent instructions:

1. ✅ Make all changes to **[`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)** - the central source of truth
2. ❌ Do NOT modify `CLAUDE.md` (this file) - it's just a pointer

## Why This Structure?

- **Single Source of Truth**: All rules maintained in one place ([`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md))
- **Consistency**: Prevents divergence between multiple instruction files
- **Maintainability**: Updates only need to be made in one location
- **Clarity**: Clear hierarchy prevents confusion about which file to update
